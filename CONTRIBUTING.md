- Fill out the PR template (if available).
- Describe **what** you've changed and **why**.
- Make sure tests pass & CI checks succeed.
- A maintainer will review, provide feedback, and merge if everything looks good.

## Style Guidelines

- Write clear & descriptive commit messages.
- Document any new public API changes.
- Include unit tests for new functionality.

## Tests & Quality

- Make sure you run tests locally before submitting.
